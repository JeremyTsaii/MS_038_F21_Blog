## Assignment 1a

### When you hear the words "Artificial Intelligence", what are the first four things that come to your mind? (p.11)

1. Maze Solvers
2. Recommendations
3. Math
4. Sentient Robots

Some of these words stem from my own experience with AI. At Mudd, there was an AI course that had various Pacman maze-solving homework problems. We also explored some of the technicalities regarding recommendation systems that power things like news feed and searches. This was also a math-intensive class, specifically using probability. Of course, AI always has a negative connotation of robots taking control and dominating the world.

### Think about the devices and/or digital services you use daily. Write beow a list of the top thre that are present in your life. (p. 23)

1. Phone
2. Laptop
3. Smart Watch

### Have these things ever surprised you by guessing something about you that you didn't expect? (p. 24)

One surprising thing that my phone did was to suggest opening a navigation app (Google Maps or Apple Maps) to my intended destination, which was correct. It seemed like it kept track of my travel history for each day of the week and was able to predict that I was going to a specific location at this time based on past trends.

### Take a moment to see if you can identify what function AI plays in the following list. (p. 24)

#### Email Inbox:
- Spam Filtering

#### Check Depositing:
- Handwriting Recognition

#### Texting and Mobile Keyboards:
- Machine Translation

#### Netflix:
- Recommendation Engines

#### Google (Search Function):
- Recommendation Engines
- Conversational Systems
- Machine Translation
- Virtual Assistants

#### Social Media Platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc.):
- Recommendation Engines
- Facial Recognition

#### Automated Message Systems:
- Conversational Systems
- Virtual Assistants

### What do we gain by having AI in our everyday lives? (p. 26)
There are various gains in our lives through AI applications. With recommendation systems, our news feed on social media platforms are filled with engaging content. With search engines, more relevant search results are surfaced to us immediately. In general, things that would be annoying to manually do are made automatic and we save time to do other things.

### What do we lose by having AI in our daily lives? (p. 26)
We can lose a sense of privacy since all aspects of our daily lives are being tracked and fed to various types of machine learning applications. Everything ranging from search history to liked shows to purchased items are all being recorded. This may seem invasive, although these features are meant to improve our lives. Additionally, machine learning algorithms can perpetuate bias depending on what type of training data was provided.

### Use the prompts below to help design an AI system. (p. 28)

#### What problem are you trying to address?
Students have to spend a lot of time searching through courses and picking them based on degree requirements and personal interests.

#### How can AI help solve this issue?
It would be cool to have some sort of application that takes both of these factors into account (perhaps through a survey) and is able to use machine learning to output a set of courses for each semester of the student's college career.

#### What role will humans have in addresing this issue?
Humans will have to oversee the creation of the recommendation algorithm and check to make sure there aren't any errors.

#### What data do you need to create an AI to help you address your issue?
There will need to be a mass amount of training data, in the form of student schedules and their corresponding interests and degrees.

#### How will you responsibly gather this data in a way that respects individuals' privacy and consent?
There can be an email to all students that asks for their interests and degree requirements, as well as their schedules by semester (completely voluntary). Then, for training purposes, all of their names will be removed and the data will be cleaned in such a way that indviduals cannot be identified.

### Use the box below to design your prototype system.
